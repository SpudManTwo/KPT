# S-KPT Patcher

S-KPT Patcher is a C-Sharp tool designed solely for the purpose of applying a fan-translated English patch to the game *Kokoro Connect: Yochi Random* for the PSP. It is a fork of the original KPT. The patch is distributed separately in the [Releases](https://github.com/SpudManTwo/KPT/releases) section of this project.

It is possible, but not advisable, to use this tool to patch other PSP ISOs. This tool is specifically designed for use with the fan translation patch for *Kokoro Connect: Yochi Random*.


## Prerequisites

* To run the patcher, you must have [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461) installed

* A legitimate *Kokoro Connect: Yochi Random* ISO


## Installation

1. Download the latest release of S-KPT Patcher and the English patch from the [Releases](https://github.com/SpudManTwo/KPT/releases) section.

2. Extract the .zip archive into wherever you'd like to store the patcher. You can delete the patcher after you've finished patching your ISO.

## Usage

1. Start S-KPT Patcher by launching KPT.exe from the folder where you extracted the patcher. Your antivirus may throw up a flag, but ask it to trust the patcher.

2. Click the "Easy Patch" Button.

3. Select the path to the Kokoro Connect Yochi Random ISO file and where you would like the patched ISO contents to be placed in the next dialog box.

4. The patcher will unpack the ISO's contents and replace them with the English patch. It will NOT overwrite your original ISO copy; the Japanese ISO will still be there after the new patched one is created.

5. Wait a few seconds while the patcher does the rest of the work.

6. When it is complete, you may close the patcher.
