# S-KPT

S-KPT is a fork of the original KPT and is designed solely for the purpose of patching Kokoro Connect Yoshi Random for the PSP. While it is possible to use this tool for other iso patching, I would not advise it as this tool is designed for use with the Fan Translation Patch for that specific game.

## Installation

S-KPT, like the original KPT, requires the .NET Framework 4.6.1 Runtime as distributed by Microsoft [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net461)

For ease of use, it is recommended that you use the pre-compiled translation files as found (here)[https://drive.google.com/open?id=1YN8hdZqJq1xPCMvfAZToc_lOUc2poZD8]

Additionally, if you'd like to master the final game files into an .iso, .cso, or similiar, then I would personally recommend using (UMDGen)[https://umdgen.en.lo4d.com/windows].

Most importantly, **YOU MUST ALREADY HAVE A WORKING LEGITIMATE. I WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTING THE ISO OR A PATCH THAT WORKS WITHOUT THE ISO. THAT IS PIRACY** 

## How To Use (Easy)

1. Ensure you have everything installed.
2. Download the latest release of S-KPT.
3. Extract the .zip archive into wherever you'd like to store the tool. (Don't worry, you can delete the tool after you've finished patching your iso).
4. Download and extract all the contents of latest version of the pre-compiled translation files.
5. Run KPT.exe from the folder where you extracted the tool into.
6. Click the Easy Patch Button.
7. Select the Kokoro Connect Yoshi Random ISO file in the file dialogue box.
8. Select the folder where you would like the patched iso contents to be placed in the next dialogue box.
9. Select the folder where you you extracted the pre-compiled translation files. The tool will not properly unless you select the correct directory here.
10. Wait a few seconds while the tool does the rest of the work.
11. (optional) Use a tool such as UMDGen to master the patched iso contents into a single iso file.
